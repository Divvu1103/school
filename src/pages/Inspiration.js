          This college is established by the inspirations of Shri Babu Singh
          Daddu Ji a well known Education of Uttar Pradesh. His hard works and
          educational missions contributed largely towards the up gradation of
          higher Education in U.P. as well as in INDIA. He believed that
          development and growth of society and country could only be possible
          through value based education of its masses and adoption of the
          principles of transparency and ethical conduct. In his opinion
          sincerity, hard work, steadfastness and passion were the cornerstones
          for attaining success in life. These virtues were showcased in his
          thoughts and deeds. Purity of thoughts and means were as important to
          him as the objective ltself and success was meaningful only when it
          benefited society, at large. His principles, noble thoughts and
          dedication to social responsibility are the bedrock of all our
          actions, endeavors and ventures. We pray to the Almighty to give us
          strength to follow his path and carry his legacy forward.
